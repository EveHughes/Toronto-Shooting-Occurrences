# Rising Gun Violence in Toronto

## Overview

This project analyzes the rising trend of gun violence in Toronto, focusing on both temporal and geographic patterns of shootings between 2014 and 2019. Using a dataset sourced from the Toronto Open Data Portal, the study explores how the frequency and distribution of shooting occurrences have evolved over time and across different divisions of the city. The report applies data analysis techniques, leveraging tools such as tidyverse, ggplot2, and dplyr to visualize the key trends. Both graphical and numerical summaries provide insights into how shootings have become more frequent in certain areas while remaining stable in others. The analysis identifies high-risk divisions and regions where gun violence remains comparatively low.
